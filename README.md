# youtubeDL-GUI
A little weekend project where I decided I did not like any of the Youtube downloader GUIs so I thought I would just make my own. Took about the whole day but I'm happy with it. Hence the name it uses <a href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl">Youtube-DL from github.</a> Windows might mark it as a virus but I don't know how to fix that its not a virus i swear.
