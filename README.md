A little weekend project where I decided I did not like any of the Youtube downloader GUIs so I thought I would just make my own. Took about the whole day but I'm happy with it. Originally used <a href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl">Youtube-DL from github,</a> but that broke about a month after I made this due to changes to Youtube. This new version uses <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp">YT-DLP from github instead.</a> This GUI supports simple trimming and Thats About It. enjoy
its based on .NET 6.0 so you might be prompted to download that...
also all the code is super spaghetti but i Will Not fix it Haha
